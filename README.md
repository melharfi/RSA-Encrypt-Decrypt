Tool to encrypt and decrypt using RSA encryption algorithm.

This tool let you generate Private and Public Keys to Encrypt and Decrypt text using RSA Encryption.

Remember that public key is used to encrypt and is given to anyone,
and Private key is used to decrypt is a very private key.

You can use a random passphrase with a random length between 0 and 128 characters.
