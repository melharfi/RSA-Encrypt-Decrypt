Tool to encrypt and decrypt using RSA symmetric/asymmetric algorithm

This tool let you generate Private and Public Keys to Encrypt and Decrypt text using RSA Encryption.

Remember that public key is used to encrypt and should not be given to the other party,
and Private key is used to decrypt an encrypted RSA text and given to the othet party.

You can use a random passphrase with a random length between 0 and 128 characters.

If you would like only the executable here is the link to the release version:
